# Ping-Pong

Using Arrays and looping, we were supposed to create a web page where you input a number and the list that comes out has either ping, pong, or ping pong according to their divisors.

### Prerequisites

* Web browser capable of reading bootstrap, js, and html
* atom
* terminal or cmd prompt

## Specs

* Numbers Divided by 3 will read "Ping!" instead of the number (Input - 3, Output - Ping!)
* Numbers Divided by 5 will read "Pong!" instead of the number (Input - 5, Output - Pong!)
* Numbers Divided by 15 will read "Ping Pong!" instead of the number (Input - 15, Output - Ping Pong!)
* Any letters or non positive/whole numbers will come to an error message (Input - abcm, Output - Only insert positive whole numbers)

## Built With

* atom.io
* github
* Terminal
